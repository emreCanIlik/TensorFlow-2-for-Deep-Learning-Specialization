This three-course specialization is designed for machine learning researchers and practitioners looking to develop hands-on skills with TensorFlow, one of the leading deep learning frameworks.

In the first course, learners are introduced to the fundamentals of building, training, evaluating, and validating deep learning models. Key topics include regularization techniques, the use of callbacks for training monitoring, and saving/loading models effectively.

The second course dives deeper, focusing on customizing deep learning workflows. It covers building complex architectures, developing custom layers, and handling flexible data pipelines using TensorFlow's lower-level APIs. It also introduces sequence modeling.

The final course explores probabilistic deep learning, teaching how to build models that incorporate uncertainty using TensorFlow Probability. It serves both as a specialization in probabilistic modeling and an introduction to the TensorFlow Probability library.

Applied Learning Project:
Through capstone projects and hands-on assignments, learners develop practical skills in applying deep learning to real-world problems such as image classification, language translation, and text and image generation.

Prerequisites:
A good command of Python 3, foundational knowledge of machine learning and deep learning, and a solid understanding of probability and statistics (especially important for the third course) are recommended.
